# Permutation tests {-}

***

- Resampling is used without replacement

They are applied for general hypotheses tests:

\[ X_{1}, ..., X_{n} \sim F
   \quad \text{ and } \quad
   Y_{1}, ..., Y_{m} \sim G \\
   H_{0} : F = G \quad \text{ vs.} \quad H_{1} : F \neq G
\]

- Permutation tests can be performed to check for independence, 
  homogeneity, tests for more than 2 groups, etc.

Let \(Z\) be the ordered set \(\{X_{1}, ..., X_{n}, Y_{1}, ..., Y_{m}\}\)
indexed by the indices
\(\nu = \{1, ..., n, n + 1, ..., n + m\} = \{1, ..., N\}\).

Under \(H_{0}\), the chance to select \(n\) elements of \(Z\) is

\[ \frac{1}{\binom{N}{n}} = \frac{n! m!}{N!}. \]
